Initial


v1
* checks 2 data sets from 2 excel files for differences
* assume same shape / size
* generates a report highlighting the differences


v2
* same as v1
* in addition, from the 2 data sources, able to identify and color code 
    - newly added rows, and 
    - removed rows
* relatively more useful in more scenarios


v3 -- wip
* v2 iterates over rows/columns, performance may suffer for larger datasets
* also realistically, in larger datasets we are more interested in whats new / removed
